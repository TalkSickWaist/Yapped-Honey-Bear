## Additions
* Literally all I did was change the import names dialogue functionality so that the question asked when importing names actually matches the functionality of the yes/no buttons.
** Previously, it asked: If a row already has a name, would you like to skip it?
*** Click Yes to skip existing names.
*** Click No to replace existing names.
** The effect of each button was the opposite, they'd been mixed up. The question is now "If a row already has a name, would you like to overwrite it?" so the functionality fits.
